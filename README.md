Face & Smile Detector is a computer vision project that uses OpenCV and Haar cascades for detecting faces and smiles in images.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Accurately identifies faces in images using Haar cascades.
- **Smile Detection**: Detects smiles, enhancing the application's potential for emotion-based analysis.

## Future Extensions
- **Real-Time Detection**: Extend the project to perform face and smile detection in real-time video feeds.
- **Emotion Detection**: Broaden the scope from smile detection to full-fledged emotion detection.
- **Integration with Apps**: Integrate the detection features into applications, such as photo editing apps or social media platforms.
